    NO COPY AND PASTE! NONE! YES THIS IS SHOUTING! üó£üòé
    The goal is to train your hands and fingers to write code.
    Write all of the syntax to train your hands üëê.
    For each challenge, write the code from scratch, fully from scratch no matter how similar to the previous challenge.
    These challenges were written between 2 AM and 3 AM. If anything is confusing as a result, be sure to ask for clarification.
    Remember. No copy pasta. üçù Zero. Zilch. Nessuna. Ninguno. Aon Cheann.

/*
 @Challenge 01 - Write a function named `multiplyByTwo` that multiplies any number value passed in as a parameter by 2
 @Example - Sending the function a value of 6 will result in 12
 @Test - Write a console.log that shows the value of `multiplyByTwo(6)`
*/

/*
 @Challenge 02 - Write a function named `arrayLength` that console.logs the amount of items in an array.
 The function should have a variable named `numbers` with values [86, 45, 63, 29, 107]
 @Example - The function should log a value of 5 in the terminal
 @Test - Make a function call of arrayLength()
*/

/*
 @Challenge 03 - Write a function named `getBonusPoints` that loops from 1 to 110.
 Use a condition in the loop to console.log the number when it is over 100
 @Example - Expect to see 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110 in the terminal
 @Test - Make a function call of  `getBonusPoints()`

/*
 @Challenge 04 - Write a function named `findMyAge` that passes in a number as a parameter and console.logs a string stating your age.
 Use template literals to write a prase such as "I am 27 years old.".
 @Test - Make a function call of `findMyAge(27)`
*/

/*
 @Challenge 05 - Using the following function, rewrite the console.log statement to use template literals and obtain the same result.
 findValues() {
    const a = 6
    const b = 2
    console.log(a + ' is larger than ' + b + ', but not larger than ' + (a + b) + '.')
 }
 @Test - Make a function call of `findValues`
*/

/*
 @Challenge 06 - Write a function that accepts a string containing either 'hot' or 'cold' . Name the function `whatToWear`.
 Use a condition check if the temperature is "hot". If the name is "hot" console.log a message to say "Wear a t-shirt"
 Use a condition check if the temperature is "cold". If the name is "cold" console.log a message to say "Wear a jacket"
 If neither option is availalbe, console.log a message to say "Please choose either cold or hot"
 @Example - Expect to see "Wear a t-shirt" when the function is given the string 'hot'
 @Test01 - Make a function call `whatToWear('hot')`
 @Test02 - Make a function call `whatToWear('cold)`
*/

/*
 @Challenge 07 - Write a function name `showEvenNumbers` that console.logs all even numbers in an array
 The function should have a variable named `numbers` with a value of [2, 25, 7, 10, 3, 42, 16]
 The function should use a condition in loop to console.log numbers of 2, 10, 42 and 16
 Hint: You can determine if a number is even if it is evenly divisible by 2
 @Example - calling `showEvenNumbers` will result in the terminal displaying 2, 10, 42 and 16
 @Test - Make a function call of `showEvenNumbers()`
 */

/*
 @Challenge 08 - Write a function named `getLowScore` that finds the lowest value in an array of scores
 @Example - Sending the function a value of [96, 72, 80, 51] will result in 51
 @Test - Write a console.log that shows the value of `getLowScore([96, 72, 80, 51])`
*/

/*
 @Challenge09 - Write a function named `addNumbers` that console.logs the result of adding multiple numbers in an array together.
 The function should have a variable named `numbers` with the value of [23, 33, 12, 41, 18].
 @Example - Expect the function to console.log a value of 128
 @ Test - Make a function call of `addNumbers()
*/

/*
 @Challenge10 - Write a function named `findCurrentGrade` that returns an average of an array of scores,
 then console.logs whether the score is a `Passing` or `Failing`.
 The function should have a variable named `scores` with the values [92, 85, 100, 74, 89].
 The function should have a condition to assign a `Passing` or `Failing`:
    Less than 65 = Failing
    65 or greater = Passing
 Hint: Use arr.length to get the amount of items in array to divide from the sum of the scores.
 @Example - Expect the result of sending in the function `findCurrentGrade` to be `Passing`
 @Test - Make a function call of `findCurrentGrade()`
