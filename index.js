    Write all of the syntax to train your hands üëê.
    For each challenge, write the code from scratch, fully from scratch no matter how similar to the previous challenge.
    These challenges were written between 2 AM and 3 AM. If anything is confusing as a result, be sure to ask for clarification.

 @Challenge 05 - Write a function that returns an array that is named `getTheTwenties` that loops from 1 to 60 and returns an array of all the 20's
 Use a condition in the loop to push to an array when the i is greater than or equal to 20 and under 30
 @Example - Expect an array returned with value of [20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29]
 @Test - console.log the result of a function call of  `getTheTwenties()` and expect to see an array value of [20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29]

/* 
 @Challenge 06 - Write a function that accepts an array names. Name the function `sayHiToJim` that loops through the array of names.
 Use a condition in the loop to check if the name is "Jim". If the name is "Jim" console.log a message to say "Hi Jim"
 Use conditional logic to console.log "Ignoring " and then the name of the person being ignored.
 @Example - Expect to see "Ignorning Jane" and "Ignoring Anita Bath" when the function is given an array of ["Jane", "Anita Bath"]
 @Test01 - Make a function call `sayHiToJim(["Jane", "Anita Bath"])`
 @Test02 - Make a function call `sayHiToJim(["Jane", "Anita Bath", "Jim", "Sam Sung"])`

/* 
 @Challenge 07 - Write a function name `getEveryLittleThing` that has an array with three objects and returns an array of all of those objects
 Objects in the array should all have properties such as `size`, `singin`, `saying`. The goal is to practice writing sytax of objects within an array.
 Good background music for this challenge is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mACqcZZwG0k
 @Example - Expect to get an array of three birds

/* 
 @Challenge 08 - Write a function name `showLetterGrades` that console.logs letter grades
 The function should have a variable named `letters` with a value of ["H","G", "F", "E", "D", "C", "B", "A"]
 The function should use a condition in loop to console.log letters of A, B, C, D or F
 Poor E
 @Example - calling `showLetterGrades` will result in the terminal displaying
 F

 A
 @Test - Make a function call of `showLetterGrades()`

/* 
 @Challenge 09 - Write a function named `trackGallonsUsed` that uses a `while` loop and shows a countdown in the console of how many gallons are left until there are no gallons left
  Hint: Within the loop, decrement the i of gallons
  Hint: Use the i of gallons remaining as the predicate
 @Example - Sending the function a value of 4 will result in 
 "4 Gallons Remaining"
 "3 Gallons Remaining"
 "2 Gallons Remaining"
 "1 Gallons Remaining"
  in the terminal
 @Test - Make a function call of `trackGallonsUsed(5)`

 @Test - Write a console.log that shows the value of `getHighScore([1999,2020,3080,1111])`
