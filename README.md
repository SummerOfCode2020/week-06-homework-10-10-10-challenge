## The Mission

Write 10 Functions, 10 Loops, 10 Conditional Statements

## The Why

Watching videos, listening to instructors, reading tutorials online, and any actions that do not consist of you writing code will only get you so far. To be a successful programmer, you need lots of daily hands-on practice. Solving lots of code challenges.  Work on at least one personal project.

To reach success the fastest, write 10 of each every day.  At a minimum, write 10 of each every week.

If you can come up with parts of code for project you would like, use that data and those topics. Do things like define your data in variables, write functions to filter your data, sort your data, summarize and process your data.

In case you are not able to come up with your own project ideas, we have you covered.

In case the sample challenges included here are too easy for you, please work to combine many variables, functions, conditions and object methods together as you can manage.

## Instructions

This is basic sample excercies only. There is not solid logic to anything. Just fun'ish excercies. The "Do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti" of programming. Singers do silly practices. Now you do to.

- Fork the repo
- Clone your personal copy of the repo
- Install node modules and run tests using a command such as `npm install test`
- Write code using the guidelines in the `js` files or create your own plan
- Write at least `10` functions, `10` conditions, and `10` loops
- Use git commands to push your work
- Celebrate
- Create a pull request targeted at the SummerOfCode2020 repo
- Celebrate more

## Notes

This project uses `nodemon`. You can change it so that `npm test` uses `node` instead if that is your preference.
